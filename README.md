People Directory
================

A directory for people

**People:**
-----------
Since the directory will be made up of people, it seems that we should start with collecting their information

- first name
- last name
- mailing address (street, city, state, zip)
- email address
- phone(s)
- belongs_to organization
- image
- related people
- related people's relationships
- additional information
- username (email address?)
- password

**Organizations:**
-----------
People will belong to organizations; need to start building those out.

- name
- leader
- address
- url (only crossings has one; needed?)
- general location (for use on the website)


**Questions:**
-----------
Unanswered questions/thoughts.

- Can/should ```organizations``` be allowed to nest? (organization of organizations?)
- Access rights (who can do what, when, how, and to whom?)
